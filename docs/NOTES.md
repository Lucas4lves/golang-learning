# Some notes

 * Multi return is A THING in golang;
 * It enables cool stuff like funcs that return an error or the expected output, for error handling (which is great);

## Arrays and slices
 * are pretty cool and subtly different from each other;

## Concurrency 

* programs have memory and cpu available to run within a processor;
* in a multicore scenario, tasks are ran in a parallel fashion;
